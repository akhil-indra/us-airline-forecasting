# ‚úàÔ∏è U.S. Airline Passenger Miles Forecasting (2001‚Äì2017)

In this project I wanted to understand the travel patterns airlines passengers in the U.S. Has it changed over time? and to see if we can use that past data to predict future values. I worked with monthly airline passenger miles from **2001 to 2016**, then forecasted what 2017 might look like using Excel.

### Dataset

The dataset contains **monthly passenger miles flown by U.S. airlines** from 2001 through 2017.

I split the data:
- 2001‚Äì2016: Used for building the forecast
- 2017: Used to test how accurate that forecast actually was

---

### Approach

I used **Excel's Forecast Sheet** to build a time series model. It handled the trend and seasonality automatically and gave me monthly predictions for 2017. After that, I compared those predictions to the actual 2017 data and calculated error metrics to evaluate the model‚Äôs accuracy.

Additonally I also created line graphs, bar charts, and tables to better understand the data and explain the results.

#### Seasonality (monthly trends over time)

_Peak travel season appear to be mid-year as July and August consistently show the highest passenger miles._


#### Long-term growth patterns

_Despite a dip around 2009, passenger miles steadily increased over the years - strong recovery trend._


#### Model accuracy using **MAE**, **MAPE**, and **MASE**

_Predictions closely follow actual values so strong short-term model performance._


#### Forecast with confidence bounds

_Confidence intervals widen over time which may lead to increased uncertainty in long term predictions._

### üìä Key Takeaways

- **Air travel in the U.S. has grown steadily** over the years, despite major disruptions like 9/11 and the 2008 recession.
- There‚Äôs a clear **seasonal trend** ‚Äî travel peaks in **summer (especially July‚ÄìAugust)** and drops sharply in **February**.
- The Excel forecast did a good job:
  - **MAE**: ~1.2 million miles
  - **MAPE**: 1.55%
  - **MASE**: 0.475 (which means it did better than a na√Øve model)

The predictions stayed close to the actual values in most months, especially during peak travel times.

---

#### Tools and Skills Applied: 

- **Microsoft Excel Forecast Sheet**
- Time series modeling and evaluation
- Data visualization (line plots, bar charts)
- MAE / MAPE / MASE calculation
- Interpreting seasonal and trend components
- Explaining results in a simple, clear way

### üí¨ Final Thoughts

This project helped me get better at thinking through a data problem from start to finish ‚Äî not just making predictions, but checking how well those predictions hold up. It was also good practice in using real-world data, dealing with trends and seasonality, and explaining results in a way that makes sense without needing to open up every formula.
