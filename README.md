# ✈️ U.S. Airline Passenger Miles Forecasting (2001–2017)

This project analyzes and forecasts monthly U.S. airline passenger miles using time series data from **2001 to 2016**, with **2017** used for model validation.

Using Excel's built-in Forecast Sheet, I generated monthly predictions for 2017 and compared them to actual miles traveled to evaluate model performance. I then calculated multiple error metrics to assess accuracy and explain the model's strengths and limitations.

## 🧰 Tools & Skills Used

- Microsoft Excel Forecast Sheet
- Pivot Tables, Line Charts, Seasonal Graphs
- Time Series Forecasting
- Error Metrics: MAE, MAPE, MASE, MSAPE
- Data Visualization and Evaluation
- Business Interpretation of Forecasts

---

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Understand long-term and seasonal travel trends across U.S. air travel
- Forecast 2017 passenger miles based on 16 years of historical data
- Evaluate model performance using multiple error metrics
- Visualize data patterns and prediction performance

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Annual passenger miles** grew ~28% between 2001 and 2016, despite dips during 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis.
- Clear **seasonal trends**: peaks in **July and August**, lows in **February**.
- Forecast model achieved strong performance:
  - **MAE**: 1.2 million miles  
  - **MAPE**: 1.55%  
  - **MASE**: 0.475 (outperforms naïve model)

> ✅ The model’s predictions closely followed actual values — especially during peak travel months like July.

## 📌 Why This Project Matters

This project helped me understand how real-world data behaves over time — how **shocks like 9/11 or economic downturns** show up in the numbers, and how forecasting tools can be used for **real business planning**. It also pushed me to think critically about **model evaluation**, not just predictions.
